For this exercise, I am going to simulate data from a (hypothetical) vaccine cohort of individuals who received various doses of a vaccine. Samples are collected on days 0, 7, 21, 28, 35, 56, 180, and 365 and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The following variables are to be included: `id`, `dose`, `days`, `antibody`, `titer.` Brief descriptions of the variables are as follows:

-   `id` is an identifier for each participant
-   `dose` is the numerical dose of vaccine for which the individual received in micrograms (mcg)
-   `days` represents the number of days since vaccination for which the sample was collected (0, 7, 21, 28, 35, 56, 180, 365)
-   `antibody` is the corresponding antibody being detected by ELISA (IgG, IgA)
-   `titer` is the measurement of the amount of antibody in the sample
