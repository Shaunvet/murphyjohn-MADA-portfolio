Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time.

As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

    "text": "This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory analysis and statistical analysis on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

For each years category, there is an observation for each sex (Female, Male), and within each sex, an observation for each of 6 age groups (20-29,30-39,40-49,50-59,60-69,70 and over). This makes \\(6*2=12\\) observations each year and \\(10*12=120\\) total observations in the data. Each observation has a value for percentage of population with obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension.\nObesity overall has mean 35.31 with (30.57, 40.90) quartiles. For every one unit increase in year group, there is a \\(1.2\\) unit increase in obesity. Male sex has \\(3.03\\) unit decrease in obesity from female sex. Excluding the final age category, for every subsequent age group, there is a \\(3.14\\) unit increase in obesity. There is no difference in obesity between age categories “20-29” and “70 and over”.\nHypertension overall has mean 49.98 with (30.65, 70.90) quartiles. There is no obvious relationship between hypertension and year or sex. For every subsequent age group, there is a \\(13.56\\) unit increase in hypertension.\nCholesterol overall has mean 14.35 with (8.5, 18.55) quartiles. For every one unit increase in year, there is a \\(0.9\\) unit decrease in cholesterol. Male sex has \\(3.45\\) unit decrease in cholesterol from female sex. For every subsequent age group, there is a \\(1.64\\) unit increase in cholesterol.\n\n\nEND OF PART 1\n\n\nThis section contributed by Asmith Joseph\n\n\nRunning the Data\nTo read the data, I set my working directory to match the project structure using setwd(“C:/Users/ajose35/Desktop/Ecole/MADA-course/murphyjohn-MADA-portfolio/coding-exercise”). Since the dataset was located in a different folder than expected, I used here::i_am(“cdcdata-exercise/data/raw/rawdata.csv”) to manually define the project root without modifying my collaborator’s code. After ensuring that here correctly resolved the file path by running file.exists(here::here(“cdcdata-exercise/data/raw/rawdata.csv”)), I successfully loaded the dataset using dat &lt;- read.csv(here::here(“cdcdata-exercise/data/raw/rawdata.csv”)). This approach allowed me to work with the existing project structure while maintaining compatibility with my collaborator’s code.\n\n\nGenerate Synthetic Data with the Same Structure\nBased on the summary the dataset contains:\nCategorical variables: Survey.Years, Sex, Age.Group, Measure Numeric variables: Percent, Standard.Error, Lower.95..CI.Limit, Upper.95..CI.Limit.

Obesity trends over time show a slight decline (-0.488 per year), but this effect is not significant (p = 0.447). Hypertension rates are slightly higher in males (+1.711), but the difference is insignificant (p = 0.653). Cholesterol levels increase slightly with age (+0.164), but age has no meaningful impact (p = 0.811).\nAll models have low R-squared values, indicating weak predictive power. The dataset likely lacks key variables or requires better transformations to capture meaningful patterns.\n\n\nComparing the Synthetic and Original Data\nThis comparison will allow me to check similarity, compare means and standard deviations.\n\n#  Comparing the Synthetic and Original Data\n\ncomparison_table &lt;- tibble(\n  Variable = c(\"Obesity\", \"Cholesterol\", \"Hypertension\"),\n  Original_Mean = c(35.31, 14.35, 49.98),  # Replace with real means\n  Synthetic_Mean = c(mean(synthetic_dat4$obesity), mean(synthetic_dat4$cholesterol), mean(synthetic_dat4$hypertension)),\n  Original_SD = c(6.58, 6.94, 24.05),\n  Synthetic_SD = c(sd(synthetic_dat4$obesity), sd(synthetic_dat4$cholesterol), sd(synthetic_dat4$hypertension))\n)\n\nprint(comparison_table)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  Variable     Original_Mean Synthetic_Mean Original_SD Synthetic_SD\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Obesity               35.3           46.4        6.58         18.0\n2 Cholesterol           14.4           45.9        6.94         17.7\n3 Hypertension          50.0           48.2       24.0          19.1\n\n\nThe comparison between the synthetic and original datasets shows some differences in means and standard deviations for obesity, cholesterol, and hypertension. Obesity levels in the synthetic data (Mean = 46.36, SD = 17.97) are higher than the original (Mean = 35.31, SD = 6.58), suggesting a wider distribution. Cholesterol levels also appear inflated in the synthetic dataset (Mean = 45.90 vs. 14.35), with a higher standard deviation (17.67 vs. 6.94), indicating greater variability. Hypertension levels, however, remain closer to the original data (Mean = 48.25 vs. 49.98, SD = 19.10 vs. 24.05), showing a better match.\nOverall, while hypertension is relatively well-aligned, obesity and cholesterol in the synthetic dataset deviate significantly from the original, suggesting the need for better parameter tuning to improve realism."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Murphy! I’m a first-year Epidemiology and Biostatistics PhD student and my concentration is Data Analysis and Modeling. Prior to UGA, I studied Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico. There, I joined a lab where I got to use math and stats to research tick-borne diseases, and that’s where my interest in public health started! Currently, I’m working on infectious disease modeling, specifically influenza and norovirus.\n\nPrior Experience\nI have prior experience with a few coding languages (R, Python, MATLAB, a touch of SAS) with R being my preferred. I’ve completed a wide range of coursework in statistics, including Regression/ANOVA, Probability, Intro Biostatistics, and Data Analysis. I’ve worked on projects that have used Regression/ANOVA, survival analysis, spatial statistics, and time series methods. I’m really looking forward to this course as an opportunity to expand my data analysis skills, improve my workflow, and enjoy digging into some more data!\n\n\nInterests\nAfter working hours, you can usually find me practicing hot yoga. On the weekends, I love trekking the trails of northern Georgia. While I deeply miss the mountains in New Mexico, I’ve discovered some impressive waterfalls here. I also enjoy climbing and running - I ran my first half marathon in November!\n\n\nClimbing Data Analysis\nI found this cool climbing data analysis by Mark Dodd. He used self-reported climbing data to compile an analysis of climber demographics by max grade. There seems to be an issue with his link to the original data, but I found another version here. I really enjoy reading and working through data analysis examples like this—it reminds me that coding is fun!"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/murph/Documents/Github/murphyjohn-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R.

Brief descriptions of the variables are as follows:\n\nid is an identifier for each participant\nage is the participant’s age at day 0\ndose is the numerical dose of vaccine for which the individual received in micrograms (mcg) (10, 100, 1000)\ndays represents the number of days since vaccination on which the sample was collected\ntiter is the measured amount of antibody in the sample\n\nThe simulation assumes the following:\n\nThe immune response follows a logistic growth function up to a peak, followed by an exponential decay.\nOlder individuals have a weaker boost in response to vaccination.\nBaseline titers (day 0) are independent of dose and vary between individuals.\nIndividual variation is present in peak titer, growth rate, decay rate, and peak timing.\nTiters are strictly positive."
